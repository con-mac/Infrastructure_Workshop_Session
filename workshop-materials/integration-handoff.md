# Check application logs
aws logs get-log-events --log-group-name workshop-apache-access --log-stream-name $(aws logs describe-log-streams --log-group-name workshop-apache-access --query 'logStreams[0].logStreamName' --output text)
```

**Issue 2: Database Connection Failures**
```bash
# Check database status
aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier $(terraform output -raw db_endpoint | cut -d'.' -f1)

# Check security group rules
aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids $(terraform output -raw db_security_group_id)

# Test connectivity
telnet $(terraform output -raw db_endpoint) 3306
```

**Issue 3: CI/CD Pipeline Failures**
