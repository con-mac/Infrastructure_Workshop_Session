### ‚ùå Current Problem

**Symptom:** `instructor-dashboard.html` returns 403 Access Denied when accessed via S3 website endpoint

**Puzzling Fact:** `index.html` works fine, but `instructor-dashboard.html` doesn't, even though:
- Both files are in the same bucket
- Both files are covered by the same bucket policy
- Both files have the same permissions
- Both files exist and are uploaded

---

### üîç Remaining Troubleshooting Steps

#### Step 1: Verify Bucket Policy is Actually Applied
**Action:** Download the current bucket policy from S3 console and verify it matches what we expect

**Expected Policy:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "PublicReadGetObject",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::infrastructure-workshop-2025-registration-535002854646/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

#### Step 2: Check File Metadata
**Action:** Check if `instructor-dashboard.html` has different metadata or encryption settings than `index.html`

**How to Check:**
1. Click on `instructor-dashboard.html` in S3
2. Go to "Properties" tab
3. Check "Server-side encryption"
4. Check "Metadata" section
5. Compare with `index.html`

#### Step 3: Re-upload instructor-dashboard.html
**Action:** Delete and re-upload the file to ensure it has the same settings as index.html

**Steps:**
1. Delete `instructor-dashboard.html`
2. Upload it again with the same method used for `index.html`
3. Test access immediately after upload

#### Step 4: Check for Bucket-Level Restrictions
**Action:** Check if there are any other policies or settings blocking access

**How to Check:**
1. Go to bucket "Permissions" tab
2. Check "Access Analyzer findings"
3. Check if there's a "Bucket policy for public access" warning
4. Look for any other restrictions or policies

#### Step 5: Test with Different File Name
**Action:** Rename instructor-dashboard.html to something simpler to rule out filename issues

**Steps:**
1. Copy `instructor-dashboard.html` and rename to `dashboard.html`
2. Upload `dashboard.html`
3. Try accessing: `http://...s3-website.../dashboard.html`

---

### üí° Actions Taken

#### Attempt 1: Re-upload instructor-dashboard.html
**Result:** ‚ùå Still getting 403 Access Denied

**Error Details:**
```html
<Code>AccessDenied</Code>
<Message>Access Denied</Message>
<Key>error.html</Key> (trying to load error.html which doesn't exist)
```

---

### üîç Current Hypothesis

The 403 error is showing that S3 is trying to load `error.html` as a custom error document. This suggests:

1. **The file itself might be returning an error** (404 or similar)
2. **S3 static website hosting** is configured to use `error.html` for errors
3. **But `error.html` doesn't exist**, causing a secondary error

**This creates a cascade:**
1. User tries to access `instructor-dashboard.html`
2. S3 returns an error (possibly 404 - file not found)
3. S3 tries to serve `error.html` as custom error page
4. `error.html` doesn't exist
5. User sees "Access Denied" + "NoSuchKey: error.html"

---

### üéØ Next Action: Test File Existence

**Step 1: Verify the file is actually accessible**

Try accessing the file via the S3 object URL (not website endpoint):
`https://infrastructure-workshop-2025-registration-535002854646.s3.amazonaws.com/instructor-dashboard.html`

**Expected Results:**
- If this works ‚Üí File exists, issue is with static website hosting config
- If this fails ‚Üí File upload issue or encryption/metadata problem

**Step 2: Compare with index.html**

Try accessing index.html via S3 object URL:
`https://infrastructure-workshop-2025-registration-535002854646.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html`

**Compare the results** - if index.html works via object URL but instructor-dashboard.html doesn't, there's a file-specific issue.

**Step 3: Create error.html**

Since static website hosting is looking for `error.html`, create a simple one:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Error</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Error</h1>
    <p>Something went wrong. Please go back and try again.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

Upload this as `error.html` to stop the secondary error.

### üö® CRITICAL FINDING

**Test Result:** BOTH index.html and instructor-dashboard.html return Access Denied via S3 object URL

**URLs Tested:**
- `https://infrastructure-workshop-2025-registration-535002854646.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html` ‚Üí ‚ùå Access Denied
- `https://infrastructure-workshop-2025-registration-535002854646.s3.amazonaws.com/instructor-dashboard.html` ‚Üí ‚ùå Access Denied

**Conclusion:** The bucket policy is NOT working for S3 object URLs

**However:**
- ‚úÖ index.html WORKS via S3 website endpoint: `http://...s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html`
- ‚ùå instructor-dashboard.html FAILS via S3 website endpoint: `http://...s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/instructor-dashboard.html`

**This tells us:**
1. The bucket policy works for static website hosting
2. index.html is correctly configured for static website hosting
3. instructor-dashboard.html has a specific issue preventing it from being served via static website hosting

---

### üéØ New Investigation: File-Specific Issue

**Hypothesis:** The instructor-dashboard.html file has a specific problem:
- Wrong file encoding
- File corruption during upload
- File name has invisible characters
- File size too large (26KB vs 5.2KB for index.html)

**Next Systematic Steps:**

#### Step 1: Check File Name for Hidden Characters
In S3 Console:
1. Click on `instructor-dashboard.html`
2. Check the exact object key (might have spaces or special characters)
3. Copy the exact key name

#### Step 2: Rename the File to Something Simple
1. In your local folder, rename `instructor-dashboard.html` to `dashboard.html`
2. Upload as `dashboard.html`
3. Test: `http://...s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboard.html`

#### Step 3: Check File Size Limits
The file is 26KB vs index.html's 5.2KB. While this shouldn't be an issue, let's verify:
1. Check if there are any size-based restrictions
2. Try creating a minimal version of instructor-dashboard.html
3. Upload and test

#### Step 4: Check File Encoding
1. Open instructor-dashboard.html in a text editor
2. Save as UTF-8 without BOM
3. Re-upload
4. Test

---

### üí° Immediate Action

**Try renaming the file to `dashboard.html` and uploading:**
1. Rename locally: `instructor-dashboard.html` ‚Üí `dashboard.html`
2. Upload to S3 as `dashboard.html`
3. Test: `http://infrastructure-workshop-2025-registration-535002854646.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dashboard.html`

This will help us determine if the issue is with the filename itself.
